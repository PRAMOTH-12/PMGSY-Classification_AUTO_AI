📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the PMGSY (Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana) dataset to gain valuable insights into rural road connectivity and infrastructure development across India. Using IBM Cloud Lite services, the system integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) powered by the IBM Granite model, enabling users to query the dataset in natural language and receive precise, contextual responses.

The goal is to support policy makers, government bodies, and rural development agencies in making data-driven decisions for sustainable and efficient rural infrastructure planning.

🚀 Problem Statement

Rural road infrastructure plays a critical role in improving connectivity, accessibility, and economic growth in villages. However, analyzing vast PMGSY datasets is challenging for decision-makers due to unstructured queries, lack of technical expertise, and time-consuming manual analysis.

This project solves the problem by providing an AI-powered query system that allows users to interact with PMGSY data seamlessly, generating actionable insights for planning, monitoring, and improving rural connectivity.
